Designed and deployed a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub on AWS EC2. Automated the build and deployment process of a Node.js application using Docker containers. Configured GitHub webhooks for continuous integration and Jenkins pipelines for automated delivery.
Set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu.

Integrated GitHub repository using webhooks to automate builds on code push.

Created a Dockerfile to containerize a simple Node.js application.

Configured Jenkins Freestyle job to:

Pull latest code from GitHub

Build Docker image

Run Docker container on EC2

Installed and configured Docker and Jenkins on EC2 using shell commands.

Ensured the app is accessible via EC2's public IP on port 8000.

Used Git, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS EC2 as core tools in the CI/CD pipeline.

Improved understanding of:

Cloud deployment (AWS)

Containerization (Docker)

Continuous Integration/Delivery (Jenkins)

Git-based automation (webhooks)
